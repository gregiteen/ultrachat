### 2/15/2025

- **Issue:** Encountered a persistent white screen issue upon signing out. The application would fail to render, and no console logs from within `App.tsx` were visible, even with a simplified component.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
  - Verified initial loading states of all stores (`useAuthStore`, `usePersonalizationStore`, `useUnifiedInboxStore`) were set to `false`.
  - Checked `src/main.tsx` to ensure it correctly mounts the `<App />` component.
  - Examined the routing configuration in `App.tsx` for errors.
  - Reviewed and corrected the `onAuthStateChange` function in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to handle initial session and callback logic.
  - Verified Supabase client configuration (URL, anon key, `detectSessionInUrl` disabled).
  - Restored the original authentication form in `Auth.tsx`.
  - Simplified `App.tsx` to a minimal component to isolate the issue.
  - Reinstalled dependencies with `npm install` after removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
  - Checked `tsconfig.app.json` for errors and removed the `allowImportingTsExtensions` option.
  - Checked `vite.config.ts` for any unusual configurations.
  - Attempted to run the development server on a different port (8082) using `npm run dev -- --port 8082`.
  - Asked the user to perform a hard refresh, clear the browser cache, and try a different browser.
  - Asked the user to check the terminal for errors from the Vite development server.
  - Asked the user to verify environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) and the location of the `.env` file.
  - Discovered and fixed a `useLocation()` hook error by moving it to `AppLayout.tsx`.
- **Resolution:**  Despite extensive troubleshooting, the root cause of the white screen remained elusive.  The decision was made to revert `App.tsx` to its original state and pursue alternative debugging strategies. The `useLocation` error was fixed by moving the hook to the correct context.

Each task should have a clear description, priority level, and estimated completion time. Regular updates and reviews will help ensure the project stays on track.
